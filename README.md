## About this app

This small weather app is part of a series of apps I've built to explore Remix, Vue/Nuxt, and Svelte. I mainly build projects using NextJS normally, so out of curiosity I wanted to see how these other frameworks handle things. The remaining parts of the app like weather data API and designs are the same across all of them.

This one specifically is built using Remix. What I enjoyed about Remix is loader-approach it takes. That makes it very easy to distinguish between things running on the client and things running on the server and hydrating the client when needed. So far a thing I dislike compared to the other options is that Remix seems to take quite some scaffolding/config.
